# Asia's Cafe Restaurant

School project for Asia's cafe website done by Group #1

This website is intended to serve as a live order form for registered users, giving them the option to view the day's menu, and reserve a meal in advance without having to set foot in the restaurant until they're ready to complete their purchase.

This site is built with PHP in order to interact with a secure database of users and daily menu items.
